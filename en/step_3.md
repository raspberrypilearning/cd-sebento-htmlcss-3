## Getting set up

To work through these Sushi Cards, you'll need to start with a website that you already made. For example, you can use the one that you made in the [HTML/CSS Intermediate Sushi Card series](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-intermediate-html-css-sushi){:target="_blank"}. If you prefer, you can work with [this trinket](http://dojo.soy/html3-website-start){:target="_blank"}, which is ready to use.

As you'll be working with lots of code, you may find it easier to use an offline text editor on your computer instead of Trinket. You can download code from Trinket by selecting **Download** from the **Share** menu.
